## Description

Nanophotonic nanohole arrays (NHAs) are used in various applications for their versatile optical functionalities. This project leverages deep learning to optimize the design of NHAs, improving efficiency and accuracy. The forward model predicts transmission spectra from structural parameters, while the inverse model infers structural parameters from transmission spectra.


## Data Availability

The dataset and code are available in this repository. For any specific inquiries or issues, please contact the first author.
